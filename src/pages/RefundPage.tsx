          This policy outlines the procedures and guidelines for cancellations and refunds related to Bhagwat Wisdom premium subscriptions.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Subscription Cancellation</h2>
        <p>You can cancel your premium subscription at any time through your account settings. Here's what happens when you cancel:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your subscription will remain active until the end of your current billing period.</li>
          <li>You will not be charged for subsequent billing periods.</li>
          <li>You will continue to have access to premium features until the end of your paid period.</li>
          <li>No partial refunds are provided for the remaining days in your current billing period.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Refund Eligibility</h2>
        <p>We offer refunds under the following circumstances:</p>
        <h3>2.1 New Subscriptions</h3>
        <p>If you are not satisfied with your premium subscription, you may request a refund within 7 days of initial purchase. This is a one-time courtesy for new subscribers only.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Technical Issues</h3>
        <p>If you experience persistent technical issues that significantly impair your ability to use premium features, and our support team cannot resolve these issues within a reasonable time, you may be eligible for a proportional refund.</p>

        <h3>2.3 Unauthorized Charges</h3>
        <p>If you discover unauthorized charges on your account, please contact us immediately. With proper verification, we will process a refund for any unauthorized transactions.</p>

        <h2>3. Non-Refundable Situations</h2>
        <p>Refunds will not be issued for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cancellations after the 7-day refund period</li>
          <li>Partial refunds for unused portions of your subscription</li>
          <li>Subscriptions that have been active for more than one billing cycle</li>
          <li>Claims of dissatisfaction with content without trying to resolve issues through customer support</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Refund Process</h2>
